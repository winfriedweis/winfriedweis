👋 Hi, I'm @winfriedweis!

👀 I’m an apprentice IT Specialist in application development (German: Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung) with a strong focus on Java programming. I'm also exploring other languages like C, C++, and TypeScript.

🌱 I'm expanding my skills in IT and programming, with a keen interest in building secure software structures, cybersecurity, and malware analysis. Additionally, I have a background in 3D modeling and animation, primarily using Blender.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate and learn through innovative projects, particularly those that involve secure software design and development. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and grow my expertise.
